                Portrait of Ada Lovelace, circa 1840. She is widely credited as the first computer programmer for her
                work on Charles Babbage's Analytical Engine.

                    <h3>1815</h3>
                    <p>Born Augusta Ada Byron on December 10 in London, England. She was the only legitimate child of
                        the poet Lord Byron and Anne Isabella Milbanke.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="timeline-item">
                    <h3>1816</h3>
                    <p>Ada's mother separated from Lord Byron just weeks after her birth. Ada never met her father, who
                        died when she was eight years old.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="timeline-item">
                    <h3>1833</h3>
                    <p>At the age of 17, Ada met Charles Babbage at a party and became fascinated with his Difference
                        Engine, a mechanical calculator.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="timeline-item">
                    <h3>1835</h3>
                    <p>Ada married William King, who later became the Earl of Lovelace. They had three children
                        together.</p>

                <div class="timeline-item">
                    <h3>1842-1843</h3>
                    <p>Ada translated an article on Babbage's Analytical Engine by Italian mathematician Luigi Menabrea.
                        She added her own extensive notes, which contained what is considered to be the first computer
                        program—an algorithm designed to be processed by a machine.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="timeline-item">
                    <h3>1843</h3>
                    <p>In her notes, Ada described how the Analytical Engine could be programmed to calculate Bernoulli
                        numbers. This is considered the first published algorithm specifically tailored for
                        implementation on a computer.</p>

                <div class="timeline-item">
                    <h3>1852</h3>
                    <p>Ada Lovelace died of uterine cancer on November 27 at the age of 36, the same age at which her
                        father had died.</p>

                    <h3>Legacy</h3>
                    <p>Ada's contributions to computer science were not fully appreciated until the 1950s. Today, she is
                        recognized as a pioneer in the field. The programming language Ada was named in her honor in
                        1980.</p>

                <p>"The Analytical Engine has no pretensions whatever to originate anything. It can do whatever we know
                    how to order it to perform. It can follow analysis; but it has no power of anticipating any
                    analytical relations or truths."</p>

            <h3>Ada's Contributions to Computing</h3>
            <p>Ada Lovelace's notes on the Analytical Engine include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The first algorithm designed for processing by a machine</li>
                <li>A vision for the capability of computers to go beyond mere calculating or number-crunching</li>
                <li>The concept that computers could manipulate symbols and even create music</li>
                <li>A method for the engine to repeat certain instructions, a process known today as looping</li>
            </ul>
